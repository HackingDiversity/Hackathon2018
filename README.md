# UVA Hacking Diversity - April 14th 2018

This is the coding repository for the 2018 UVA Hacking Diversity event.

## Expectations

You are not expected to complete a full application. You _are_ expected to formulate a concise statement of how you would tackle the problem, and offer a detailed explanation of what your solution would entail. The code you write should be supportive of this solution. For example, if you choose to tackle the web application problem, you are not expected to complete a full mobile-ready solution: You are expected to complete as much as you can reasonably do in the timeframe given, but then offer an explanation of what your completed solution would be like. This way, you can be judged on both your hacking and your problem-solving.

### Instructions

If you don't have a [GitHub](https://github.com) account, please create one. You will also need [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) installed on your machine.

> If you feel more comfortable with GUI interfaces, feel free to use [GitHub's Desktop](https://desktop.github.com) application.

Go to: `https://github.com/HackingDiversity/Hackathon2018` and click "Fork" in the top right. This will fork the repository to your own account.

Clone this forked repository to you computer:

    git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Hackathon2018.git

Pick the problem you want to solve, go into that folder, and create a new folder with your team name:

    cd chatbot
    mkdir MY_TEAM_NAME

Create a `README.md` file in the folder you created. It is here that you should list the names of your team members, your concise solution statement, and your longer description. It is also within this folder that you should place your code for the solution.

When you are finished, commit and push your repository to your GitHub account. From the root of the project:

    git add .
    git commit -m "MY COMMIT MESSAGE"
    git push origin master

Once this is complete, go to `https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Hackathon2018`, and click the "Pull Request" button. Follow the instructions. The pull request--along with the showcase--will be used by the judges to evaluate your project.

## Topics & Problem Definitions

* [Chatbot](./chatbot/README.md)
* [Data Science](./datascience/README.md)
* [Web Application](./webapp/README.md)

## Food

Breakfast, lunch, dinner, Snowing in Space cold brew coffee, and Wonderment treats will be available free of charge.

## Judging

There will be a judging showcase near the end of the hackathon where judges will walk around to each table, and talk to each team. In addition, judges, mentors, and spectators will likely walk around throughout the event. Feel free to talk to anyone and everyone about your project.

There are 5 judges. Each judge will independently rate the participants in each of the three topics, and then pick the top three teams for each topic. A lead judge will then aggregate the selected team ratings, calculate the scores, and finalize the winning team for each topic.

## Awards

Each winning team member will receive a Visa gift card.

## Door Prizes

We have several books donated by [No Starch Press](https://nostarch.com) and [Rosenfeld Media](https://rosenfeldmedia.com) that will be given away as door prizes. In addition, [Baron Fig](https://baronfig.com) has donated some of their high quality notebooks, while No Starch has also donated $50 eBook coupons.

## Swag

Copies of [Offscreen Magazine](https://www.offscreenmag.com), swag bags, buttons, and stickers galore will be available on a first come, first serve basis (we have a lot). 20% discount codes will be available from [Pragmatic Programmers](https://pragprog.com) and Rosenfeld Media.

## Code of Conduct

We are following the [Hack Code of Conduct](https://hackcodeofconduct.org).
