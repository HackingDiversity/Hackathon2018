## Technology
We chose to use Bootstrap in order to ensure a smooth transition from mobile to desktop. While students will want to be able to check their assignments, calendar and classes on their phone, they will certainly also be checking that information while working on their computer. For the backend, there are various options that can be implemented. Django would be a nice framework choice for the secure authentication system and the built in organizational style. It would allow us to isolate styling from the bulk of the backend, making the style easy to port from university to university.

## How Chalk & Slate focuses on inclusivity
1. WebAim color standards

  We often forget about those with poor eyesight or color blindness when designing. The colors on the Chalk & Slate application have passed at least 3 out of the 4 WebAim color standards.

2. Using alt tags and other best practices while coding

  We always try to remember the users who utilize screen readers. Not everyone can see the images and graphics on our site, and we want to ensure that the application is accessible by all students, faculty and staff.

3. Focusing on the Social component at every point of the design

  The Social tab of our dashboard will be filled with resources. We’ve elevated the importance of social, physical and mental health. Within the Social tab will be three kinds of resources.

  - #### Health

    - Each school can include resources to their on-campus centers, such as mental health counseling, the health center, sexual assault resources, and student-run hotlines. These resources will depend on each school but will also include national groups like RAIN and National Suicide Prevention Hotline.

  - #### Academic & Career

    - This will include resources that can help students with their academic life, such as peer tutoring and career focused clubs, like the American Medical Students Association.

  - #### Social

    - Having a robust social life is important, even when very busy, and this tab will help students connect to others like them. This will include groups focused on gender, religion, race and sexual-orientation but also may be more broad. While the individual groups will vary by each school, this section can also include national groups like the American Medical Women’s Association.

  Including messages encouraging students to explore these resources.

  - Reaching out for help can be tough. Our design will include simple, unintrusive messages on near the footer, encouraging students to reach out for resources if they feel overwhelmed, stressed, depressed or isolated. Links will direct students to the correct resources. (Note: Before going live, these messages would be reviewed by a professional).

## Minimum Viable Product

1. Complete Profile Page
  - On this page, linked in both the name on the top left and the footer, the user will be able to change their password and update relevant information.

2. Inbox page, clinical page, social page

## Future Iterations

1. Expand message inbox

2. Give college-level admin a way to customize parts of the application specific for their school, such as setting the login image.
