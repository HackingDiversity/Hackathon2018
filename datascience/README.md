# Data Science Problem Definition

## Requirements

We ask that you either use [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org) or [Azure Notebooks](https://notebooks.azure.com) for this problem.

> Azure Notebooks supports R, Python, and F# as programming languages.

## Challenge

Medical education is different from other education in that it has a limited number of schools and enrollments, but requires large amounts of data and meta data for evaluations and longitudinal studies. The small number of schools means that medical education is often a "tacked on" feature of educational software, since the audience is limited and the revenue is small. Most medical education solutions are homegrown, which can leave data collection and evaluation lacking. In some situations, a large amount of disparate meta data is connected, but never cleaned or evaluated, so it often can be riddled with bad data, loose correlations, and no outlet for review.

Given the [linked data set]()--which is a small subset of the actual data--the challenge is to find meaningful correlations between data points, while avoiding getting trapped by bad data. What techniques would you use to clean the data set? Which meta data attributes are more important than others in predicting future relationships and performance? How can this be visually represent most appropriately to help decision-makers?

Consider this a "Wild West" challenge. What--if anything--can be inferred from the data?
