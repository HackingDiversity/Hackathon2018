# Web Application Problem Definition

## Challenge

Medical students have a lot of material to read/explore, a lot of courses to attend, and very little time to spare. As a result, a poorly designed user experience, combined will a large amount of applications to use, can result in valuable time lost, and a lot of frustration.

The challenge is to build a mobile-ready experience for students to navigate all of their applications and courses with as few clicks as possible, and without the students getting lost in the process. You can use any technology you choose, but you should explain why you chose that particular technology.

### Things to Consider

* Students in different medical years could have access to different applications and courses.
* Students rely a lot on their calendars
* Each course has its own page with potentially 1-10 "weeks," each containing multiple sessions (e.g., lectures, labs). Each session could have its own page with details, as well as materials to download.
* Students accumulate a lot of quantitative and qualitative data over the full four years that is seldom available to them for review purposes

### Example Data

#### Applications Students Use

> Please note: Example applications and courses are just a small subset of potential applications and courses. The solution should account for a myriad of applications and courses that potentially span across four undergraduate medical education years.
